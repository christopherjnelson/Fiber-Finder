# NW Ohio Fiber Finder

The SLOW rollout of FTTH continues in NW Ohio and neither ISP offers any kind of service map for the process. So I threw together this little crowd-sourced app to allow users to report fiber availability at their location. The App utilizes React, Google Maps/Places and Supabase.
